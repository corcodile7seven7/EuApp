    "coming_soon": "Content coming in Phase 2",
    "competition_title": "How the Competition Works",
    "competition_philosophy_title": "Competency vs Knowledge",
    "competition_philosophy": "EPSO evaluates competencies, not just knowledge. The AD5 competition tests reasoning ability, analysis, and problem-solving in realistic contexts related to working in EU institutions. Memorization is not enough: you need to demonstrate critical thinking and practical application skills.",
    "competition_requirements_title": "AD5 Requirements",
    "competition_requirements": "To participate in the AD5 (Administrator) competition, a bachelor's degree is required (minimum 3 years of completed university studies). No work experience is required. Age is not an exclusion criterion. Citizenship of an EU Member State is mandatory.",
    "competition_phases_title": "The 3 Competition Phases",
    "competition_phase1": "Phase 1 - CBT (Computer-Based Testing): Verbal, numerical, and abstract reasoning tests. These tests evaluate basic cognitive abilities and are eliminatory. They take place at Prometric centers across Europe.",
    "competition_phase2": "Phase 2 - EU Knowledge & Digital Skills: Tests on EU knowledge (treaties, institutions, policies) and digital skills (DigComp 2.2). This phase is also eliminatory.",
    "competition_phase3": "Phase 3 - Case Study (EUFTE): A written exercise on a practical case related to working in EU institutions. Tests the ability to analyze, synthesize, and communicate in writing in Language 2.",
    "competition_eliminatory_title": "Eliminatory Mechanism",
    "competition_eliminatory": "Each phase is eliminatory: you must reach the minimum threshold in EVERY section to proceed to the next phase. An insufficient score in even one section results in elimination, even if other sections are excellent. The final weighted score determines your position on the reserve list.",
    "strategy_title": "Strategy and Tips",
    "strategy_verbal_title": "Verbal Reasoning (35%)",
    "strategy_verbal": "Read the passage carefully BEFORE looking at the options. Look for the answer that is SUPPORTED by the text, not one that seems reasonable in general. Watch for words like 'all', 'never', 'always' - they often indicate wrong answers. Eliminate options that go beyond the text or contradict a specific detail.",
    "strategy_numerical_title": "Numerical Reasoning",
    "strategy_numerical": "Read the data carefully before starting calculations. Mentally estimate the answer to eliminate clearly wrong options. Pay attention to units of measurement and time periods. Wrong options are often the result of common calculation mistakes (forgetting a percentage, inverting numerator/denominator).",
    "strategy_abstract_title": "Abstract Reasoning",
    "strategy_abstract": "Look for patterns in these attributes: shape, color, size, rotation, position, number of elements. Usually 2-3 attributes change at a time according to different rules. If you don't see the pattern immediately, try comparing consecutive figures to understand what changes between them.",
    "strategy_time_title": "Time Management",
    "strategy_time": "In the CBT you have approximately 105 seconds per verbal question, 120 for numerical, and 60 for abstract. Don't spend too much time on a single question: flag uncertain ones and come back if time allows. Remember: there are no penalties for wrong answers, so ALWAYS answer every question.",
    "strategy_general_title": "General Tips",
    "strategy_general": "Do many exam simulations to familiarize yourself with the format and time pressure. Alternate single-category practice with mixed sessions. Use the 'Smart Training' feature to focus on weak areas. On exam day: sleep well, arrive early, read carefully.",
    "accommodation_title": "Reasonable Accommodation / SLD",
    "accommodation_what_title": "What is Reasonable Accommodation",
    "accommodation_what": "EPSO offers reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities, medical conditions, or special needs. This includes SLD (specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, ADHD), physical disabilities, chronic conditions, and other documented needs.",
    "accommodation_procedure_title": "Request Procedure",
    "accommodation_warning": "WARNING: The request for reasonable accommodation is MANDATORY at the time of registration for the competition. It cannot be submitted later. If you do not request it during registration, you lose the right.",
    "accommodation_procedure": "During online registration for the competition, in the 'Access requirements' section, select the option to request accommodations. You will need to specify your condition and the accommodations needed. EPSO will contact you for details and documentation.",
    "accommodation_extra_time_title": "Extra Time",
    "accommodation_extra_time": "The extra time granted is typically 20-25% more than the standard time. For example, if a test has 60 minutes, you might receive 72-75 minutes. The exact time depends on the documented condition and EPSO's assessment.",
    "accommodation_neurodiversity_title": "EU Approach to Neurodiversity",
    "accommodation_neurodiversity": "The European Union actively promotes inclusion and the value of neurodiversity. Requesting accommodation does NOT negatively affect your evaluation. It is a right provided by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, ratified by the EU. EPSO treats this information with the utmost confidentiality.",
    "accommodation_docs_title": "Required Documentation",
    "accommodation_docs": "Recent medical documentation is required (generally no older than 3 years) certifying the condition and its impact on test-taking abilities. For SLD: diagnostic certification. For physical disabilities: specialist medical certificate. Documents can be in any official EU language.",
    "languages_title": "Languages L1 and L2",
    "languages_l1_title": "Language 1 (L1) - Mother Tongue",
    "languages_l1": "Language 1 is your main language, which must be one of the 24 official EU languages. Verbal reasoning tests are taken in your L1. You must have native-level proficiency (C2) in this language.",
    "languages_l2_title": "Language 2 (L2) - Communication Language",
    "languages_l2": "Language 2 must be different from L1 and must be English, French, or German (EN/FR/DE). EU Knowledge tests, Digital Skills, the Case Study, and communications with EPSO are in L2. The choice of L2 is strategic: choose the one you're strongest in.",
    "languages_level_title": "Required Level",
    "languages_level": "The minimum level required for L2 is B2 (CEFR). However, to be competitive, a C1 level is strongly recommended. The Case Study (EUFTE) in particular requires excellent writing ability in L2. Invest time in improving your L2 if needed.",
    "languages_verbal_warning_title": "Don't Underestimate Verbal in L1",
    "languages_verbal_warning": "Don't underestimate the verbal reasoning test even though it's in your mother tongue. The EPSO format requires a specific type of logical reasoning applied to complex texts. Even native speakers can find difficulty with deduction, inference, and assumption questions. Practice regularly."
